# CSSI-Final-Proj-Puzzle-Game-Site
I participated in Google's Computer Science Summer Institute (CSSI) in 2022. For the final project, we were put in groups of 3 and told to create any kind of website using the HTML, CSS, and JavaScript skills that we developed. I created this basic puzzle game website with my group partners, Christopher and Eahn.
